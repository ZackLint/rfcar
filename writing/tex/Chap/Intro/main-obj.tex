\section{Main objectives}
The goal of the present work is to close the gap between design and fabrication of
multi-material components from metallic/ceramic materials using
\gls{sls}/\gls{slm} technology. To this end several main objectives have been
outlined:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Develop a design methodology for multi-material fabrication of
    metals/ceramics;
  \item Instantiate a practical workflow and respective toolchain from the
    design methodology;
  \item Develop and build a proof-of-concept equipment capable of producing
    such components;
  \item Test the production of multi-material components using the proposed
    workflow/toolchain and the equipment built.
\end{enumerate}
