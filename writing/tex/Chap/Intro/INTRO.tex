One of the ultimate goals of engineering is the ability to provide sustained 
development, by efficiently using the available resources --- materials, energy,
knowledge, time. This is a ``Sisyphus's stone''\footnote{King of Ephyra,
condemned to push a stone uphill for eternity --- immortalised in ``The Myth of
Sisyphus'' by Albert Camus}, a perpetual quest for optimisation of efforts and
resources. One such example in the engineering field is the ability to produce
components with the minimum amount of material needed for its function, i.e.,
functional design of components without restrictions to geometry or type and
number of different materials; instead the focus should be on the desired
properties of such components, customising them for the specific field of
application.
