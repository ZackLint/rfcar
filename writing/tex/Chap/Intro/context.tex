\section{Context}
The functional design of components is a complex topic, with a myriad of
questions to be answered: what is the function of the component?; what design
criteria must be met to fulfil its function?; how will the component be
produced, and what data does it require?; how will the component's performance
be measured?, among others. The answers are often not clear or simple as they
dictate the use of several materials and several manufacturing technologies,
increasing severely the complexity of producing such components: how to
effectively combine two or more materials into a single component in a
synergistic way?
