\section{Motivation}
The possibility of controlling composition or structure and thus obtain
components with desired local properties, as regarding mechanical, tribological,
thermal properties, and others are of great interest, as material is only added
where it functionally needed, minimising waste and enhancing the overall
properties of the component being built.
