\chapter*{Abstract}
Functional design is the desirable and most sustainable method to design
products: by adding the material only where is strictly required to perform its
function, the resources usage is optimized, especially materials and
energy. However, functional design may dictate the usage of several materials or a combination of them to fulfill its goal, which is hindered by the
current manufacturing methodologies. An example of a class of
products where functional design is key is biomedical implants, like the hip implant.
